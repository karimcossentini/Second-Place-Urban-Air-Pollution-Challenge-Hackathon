# Third-Place-Urban-Air-Pollution-Challenge-Hackathon

You may have seen recent news articles stating that air quality has improved due to COVID-19. This is true for some locations, but as always the truth is a little more complicated. In parts of many African cities, air quality seems to be getting worse as more people stay at home. For this challenge weâ€™ll be digging deeper into the data, finding ways to track air quality and how it is changing, even in places without ground-based sensors.The objective is to predict PM2.5 particulate matter concentration in the air every day for each city. PM2.5 refers to atmospheric particulate matter that have a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometers and is one of the most harmful air pollutants.
